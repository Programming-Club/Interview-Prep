Question: Rotate Matrix

Given an NxN matrix, write a function called rotateMatrix that rotates the
    matrix 90 degrees. Use any language.

EX:

1 2 3         7 4 1
4 5 6    =>   8 5 2
7 8 9         9 6 3
Before        After



Hints:

1) Try thinking about it layer by layer. Can you rotate a specific layer?
2) Can you solve this without copying any part of the matrix?
